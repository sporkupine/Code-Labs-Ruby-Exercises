# Define a class called Animal and set attributes name, animal_type and color using the method attr_accessors (keep in mind, attributes refer to instance variables).
# Initialize an Animal instance and store it in a variable called dog.
# Access attributes name in dog and set it to "Clifford". Fill in the rest of the attributes.
# Print out each attribute dog holds.

# Create an instance method called intro. When you call intro, it should print Hey, my name is Clifford. I'm red and I am a dog to the console. Use string interpolation to do this.
