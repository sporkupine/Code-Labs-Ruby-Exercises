# Define a class called Person and set instance attributes name and age using the method attr_accessors.
# Define an initialize method that will set each attribute.
# Create a class variable called people.
# Every time an instance gets created, push that instance in the class variable people. Do so in the initialize method.
# Create a class method called print_all_people. 
# Loop through people and print each name and age in the format of "Name: John Doe, Age: 54". 
# Call this method to see if the results are correct.
