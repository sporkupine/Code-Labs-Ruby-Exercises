# Ruby Exercises and Terminology 
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - a generalization of a conceptual model, used to hide the implementation of details of deep functionality. <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - classification of data that defines a set of rules within a program or system for data handling. <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - a reference to a value in memory <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em>
  - A local variable is only accessible within the block of its initialization.
  - a constant variable will always start with a capital letter. Constants are used for values that are not supposed to be changed.
  - a global variable will always start with a $. Global variables have global scope, and are available from anywhere within a program.
 
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - scope is the "region" of a program in which a variable or method can be utilized. <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - a set of expressions that returns a value. similar to functions in JavaScript. <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive RuBy. IRB is a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, ,Loop) program that can be accessed from the terminal. <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - An operator is a symbol that represents an operation to be performed with one or more operand.  <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - a class is a blueprint from which an object (or an instance of an object) is created. <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - a gem is a library of code that can be imported and used in a Ruby project. <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - Any expression that evaluates to true or false. <br>
<em>**The difference between else and elsif**</em> - elsif provides a second if statement, else only handles cases when if statement evaluates to false <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements?**</em> - Provides a variable and a set of conditions, with blocks of code to run on the variable when the conditions are met. <br>
<em>**What is a data structure?**</em> - any of a number of specialized means of storing and accessing data within a computer. <br>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - Indexed lists of data used for many programming applications. <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - a function or block of code that is called multiple times, often iterating over an array or a hash and modifying each item inside. <br>
<em>**Recursion**</em> - Calling a function inside itself to create a "recursive" loop. When used unintentionally this can cause memory leaks and application crashes. <br>

## Part 3
<em>**What is Object Oriented Programming?**</em> - A programming paradigm that organizes software design around data in objects rather than functions and logic. <br>
<em>**Class inheritance**</em> - the process by which a class "inherits" the attributes and methods of another class, often a "parent" class. <br>
<em>**What are getters and setters?**</em> - Methods used for accessing ("get") or updating ("set") data within an object. <br>
<em>**Difference between class variables and instance variables and class attributes?**</em> - class variables have only one copy of the variable to be shared within each instance of a class. Instance variables are available within each individual instance of their parent class. <br>
<em>**What does self signify in a class?**</em> - Self works like "this" in JavaScript. It is a keyword that gives you access to the currently referenced object. <br>
<em>**Modules</em> - a Module is a self-contained set of code containing one or more routines. Modules can be used to keep a program organized and code reusable. <br>

## Part 4
<em>**Bundler**<em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
<em>**Gemfile**<em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
<em>**Bcrypt**<em> - INSERT DEFINITION HERE <br>
